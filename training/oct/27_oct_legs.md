### Only thing that sucks about bodyweight/home leg training is you will have to trade your intensity for volume and that is a turnoff for me. but, thats the only option. atleast for now. maybe will join a gym in college. or maybe not, i like bodyweight more, much more fun.

1. Pistol Squats - 3 x (9, 9, 7)
2. BG Split Squats - 3 x (41, 48, 49)
3. Sissy Squats - 2 x (14, 12)
4. RDLs - 2 x (41, 42)
5. Nordic Curls - 3 x (19, 17, 12)

## Did not go full intensity this workout because this is the first leg day of new mesocycle, and personally, my legs need a week or two to adopt to a new program. Still good quad and ham pump, skipped calves today because was in a hurry, will train them tomorrow
