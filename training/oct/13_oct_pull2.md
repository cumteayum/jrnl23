# Ok, A good pull day.
Didnt sleep yesternight.

0. Deadlifts - 

1. Meadows Rows - 60kgs, 3 x(8, 7, 9)
2. Deadstop Rows - 90kgs, 2 x(9, 7)
3. Pullups - 3 x(9, 12, 11)
4. DB Rows - 25kgs, 2 x(17, 16)
5. Curls+RD Rows superset - (19, 14, 9)

Felt weak due to sleep deprivation. Henceforth did not add weight to pullups today.

Removed all the songs from ultrachill (playlist primary) that reminded me of my ex.

Felt much better :)
