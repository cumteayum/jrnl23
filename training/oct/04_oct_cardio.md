# 04 October 2023, Cardio, ran a lot today.

So its cardio day again, i love it, i love endurance workouts in general, i am very happy today actually because i relearned blender all over again in less than a week, my GPU is smoking currently rendering a forest scene with just 4 light sources but i guess it's inevitable because its a 1650, not a 4090. 

Finally learned how to play "Blue" on a violin, its hard, like really hard, but i learned it! props to me!!
