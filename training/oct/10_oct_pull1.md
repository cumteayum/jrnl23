# Pull Day 01, 10 October 2023, 10:15-11:02:08

1. Weighted PullUps - 22.5kgs, 2 x (5,3)
2. Pulldowns - 60kgs, 3 x (12, 12, 11)
3. DB Rows - 30kgs, 2 x (8,7)
4. CG Pulldowns - 1 x Failure(at 12 reps) 
5. Curls+Rear Delt Fly Sueprset - 3 x (Failure on all sets)

Overall pretty good pull day, my strength on Weighted pullups is declining because im starting the winter cut.
added pulldowns again in the routine...because i like it. pulldowns are great and all but db rows are still my favourite excercise for the lats, unpreceeded lat activation, i feel it very well on the rhomboids and lats.

Overall, pretty good pull day still, a solid 9/10.
