### Format for future documents, 
Index. Exercise - Weight x (repetitions) @ RIR/Failure(F)/Max(M)
number of comma seperated elements in the parantheses denote the number of sets performed.

1. Incline Bench-91kgs x (8,6,5) @ F(all) 
2. OHP - 50kgs x (12,12) @ F(both) + Drop set 45kgs x 8 reps
3. CG Bench - 61 kgs x (8,8,5) + Drop set 50kgs x 4 reps 
4. Dips(Bodyweight)+Skullcrusher SuperSet - (14+7, 12+8, 12+5)

That's it, short and sweet.
As i always say, "Training should be simple, not easy", every set is to failure with occasional myo-reps or drop-sets.
i like drop-sets exclusively on lateral raises because it gives a legendary pump.

Anyways, What else did i today? 
well, read adolf hitler's biography, solved some long ass integrals, made some classical music, played violin, rendered epic environment in blender, speaking about blender, the development team has really updated it from the v2.3, and the new geometry nodes are magically amazing!!

One more thing i am very very happy and proud today is i solved a problem from Putnam(WLPLMC) and partly one probablity problem from 2011 IMO(The windmill problem)

I was able to reach to the conclusion that the number of breed-1 and breed-2 points on the either side of the pivot are same and will be constant throughout the "Windmill" for odd number of elements in Set S.

Honestly, such a beautiful problem.
That's why i love graphs and probablity.

PS: Got a good night's sleep yesterday after 8 days.
And im in love with [this](com/watch?v=axiZSrjgkMI&list=OLAK5uy_mQHdsWX9w-lnfCXSdZbUnu5RA58tZP010) again, such a beautiful piece!!
