Thats it, simple leg day, hams were little sore but ok.

i started training quads once per week only beacuse i was not recovering well with 2 leg days a week since i started squatting above 100kgs, i just cannot recover anymore, also do some light hamstring work on cardio days, just feels good.

Once a week frequency is fine enough, quads aer still being sore for 4 days or so, hams for a week, calves for 3-4 days.

today's training was fucking hard. nearly puked. my squat strength has decreased significantly since dengue but ok, i'll recover.
