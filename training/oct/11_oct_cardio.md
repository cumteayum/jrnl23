Ok, In short, a very beautiful day.
It's been so long i have ran hard. Met one gymbro who insisted upon going on a run with him, i agreed, dude was fucking fast.

Yes, one more thing, test marks have improved significantly. After the breakup, they were in the tank, happy that they are in a good range again(scored 211, 219, 213, 215, 223 and 189/300 in some of the mains specific tests recently), scored 97/100 in physics.
Though i suck so much in chemistry, was able to bag ~70 marks in every test. Fatima, the chemistry goddess, please come back and bestow your blessings upon me!!

Anyway, math is ok, ~55 in every test. Need to improve on neglected topics(Area under curve, ODE's, LDE,s or diff. eqns in general)

havent touched permutation combination/Probablity for over a year, need to study them too. Free marks.


One pretty interesting incident comes to my mind talking about physics marks is that in kota in 11th, around August, it was ACT-I, was fucking hard, it was a 183 mark paper consisting PCM, when the results came out, i scored 4 marks in Maths, -2 in Chemistry and -2 in Physics.

I was dead.

Then i checked my rank.

turns out i was able to get 16th rank out of 6596 students.

Well, turns out i was not that bad.

i remember the number of students so well still because i was literally saying it in my head over and over again in glee.

That, fuck man, i really bagged an under 20 rank with negative marks in two subjects!

Fun times, Fatima scored whopping 18 marks in chemistry, it was since then i started to involve with her, man i miss her, wonder what she's doing nowadays. And i got the highest marks in physics in my batch(30 students), Shaurya scored -40 in physics, but he is a math only guy, scored 8 marks.

Physics average was -31 marks.

the averages are so in negatives because EVERY SINGLE QUESTION WAS MANDATORY.

Oh man, i really do miss the kota days, still the best days of my life. two regrets i still have about that time are first, shouldnt have broken up my friendship with yashasvi, and second, shouldnt have involved with jindal.

Still, very beautiful times.

I miss them.
