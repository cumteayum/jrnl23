# Ok, It was a good push day.

1. Incline Bench - 90kgs, 3 x (7, 6, 4)
2. Flat Bench - 102.5kgs, 2 x (6, 5)
3. OHP - 45kgs, 2 x (8,6) + 2 drop sets with 30kgs 
4. CG Bench+Skullcrusher superset - [65kgs, 35kgs] 2 x (7+10, 5+12) 
5. Dips - 20kg weighted, 3 x (12, 10, 9)
6. laterals - 10kgs, 1 x Failure

On laterals, was completely exhausted due to the ohp beforehand, i know i procrastinated, will do the left sets tomorrow, strength on flat bench is declining, thats why i fucking hate cutting. but abs are important :)
