# Deload

Exams are coming, recovery is going downhill, plus i got cold. Need to deload. Completed Witcher 3 last week, pretty solid game, well deserved 10/10. Completed RE4Remake yesterday, Leon is the ultimate chad. Anyway, pretty solid week this has been, been to a date with a classmate, walked a lot with dudes. Might buy The Discourses and/or Notes from underground, been a long since i read Dostoevsky.

Well, that's pretty much the weekly summary. Might not update the repo till 12 feb or so. Will jump on a 4 day split or something along the lines in next meso.
