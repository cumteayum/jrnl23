## Overall pretty good pump, more back focused. glutes are fucking fried from the last leg session, i accidentally put one less plate on the split squat setup and they all felt on glutes rather than quads.

### 'Angles' in Rows, or how do i like to set them up is, the 'angle' denotes the angle formed by the shinbone and floor in a row's starting stretched position. so for example -30deg in rows, negative specifies im of course using a box or support to allow the legs go below the floor. just so i can overload the movement more.
