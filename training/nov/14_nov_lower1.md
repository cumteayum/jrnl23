# 14 November 2023, Leg Day, 04:31-05:26:41
## Early morning leg days are literal nightmares.

1. RDLs - 3 x max
2. Nordic Curls - 2 x max
3. BSS - 4 x max
4. Sissy Squats + Leg extension superset - 3 x max
5. Calf raises - 1 x max

### Last leg day, did 8 sets of quads, couldnt recover, so lowered the volume by 1 set. Same for calves, personally my calves grew the most when i increased frequency and decreased volume per session. hamstrings are fried, cannot do more than 4 hard sets for them.
## Overall pretty good, was feeling like puking afterwards. Hence ISHAN CERTIFIES OF THIS LEG DAY !
