## Damn bro idk why im leaning towards mentzer training style, like doing 1-2 sets for hams and still sore as fuck. Shouldve done this earlier
## Will train like this(1-3 sets each muscle group) till exams due to time contraint + seems like a pretty good opportunity to test this low volume high intensity method and might accustom my body to low volume ? yeah i like it.
