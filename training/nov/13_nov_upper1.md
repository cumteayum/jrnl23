### A friend invited me to gym today and workout with him.
1. Flat Bench - 111.11kg(245lbs), 1 top set for 5 reps, + 1 down set @ 102.5kgs(225lbs) for 9 reps
2. Incline Bench - 102.5kgs(225lbs), 2 x (9, 8) 
3. Weighted Pullups - 20.4kg, 3 x (9, 9, 7)
4. BB Rows - 93kgs(205lbs), 2 x (9, 8, 9)
5. OHP - 61.2kgs(135lbs), 2 x (8, 8)
6. Weighted Dips - 40.8kgs(90lbs), 3 x (9, 7, 8)
8. Laterals+FacePulls supersets - 2 emoms

### Pretty solid session. Felt good on bench, it increased by ~10lbs, very fucking happy about it. last time i benched, it was 235,  for clean 8 reps. so yes, thats a BIG PR!!!
### Hit a PR on OHP too, last time it was 57.5kgs for 11 clean reps, most probably its just the HSPU carry over.

### Overall very very happy with today's session. filthy chest pump. deloads really work wonders !!
