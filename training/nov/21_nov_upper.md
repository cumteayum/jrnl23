# 21 November 2023, Upper Day, 04:59-05:53:07

1. Dips - Bagpack 11kgs, 7 x (16, 19, 14, 12, 11, 9, 9)
2. Pullups - Bagpack 11kgs, 10 x (15, 12, 11, 11, 9, 9, 10, 10, 9, 7)
3. Face Pulls - 5 x max 

## Pretty simple upper day tbh, just spammed dips and pullups, fucking exhausted to do anymore pressing or pulling.
## Pumped asf. might need some upper chest emphasis on next upper day. maybe will cut off dips next session.
