## REALLY FUCKING EXHAUSTING, cannot take this much fatigue for a full meso. need to work more on cardio. overall good pump. dips felt really really good. bench strength has gone up quite significantly, maybe will cruise around 245lbs on bench till new year. Aiming for 250lbs flat bench on new year. quite possible.
