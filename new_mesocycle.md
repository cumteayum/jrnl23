# Alright, im changing the bro split for an upper lower 5x a week because i didnt realize how much im cutting on the intensity. so i need more frequency to make up for it, thats the only problem i have had with home workouts.

## Ok so the detailed split [can be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S1L2QUwIHo8ENhhEy83uEkm2LBseaHYVEa4AQWljX8E/edit)
# Edit: Tweaking the split a little bit to plug in some more recovery plus reducing sets.

## well, i didnt expect this split to feel this good, the pumps are not as good as the bro split but the overall experience is good. 8/10 recommended
